    <p className="mx-5">My name is Marcia Harris. I am a web developer with a background in sales and marketing. I have experience in JS, CSS, HTML, React, Express, Github, MongoDB
    Understanding JS,CSS and HTML as well as express and MongoDB have allowed me to develop the skills necessary for full-stack development with a fondness for front-end development.
   

My goal is to work as a full-stack developer at a company dedicated to making life easier for the everyday person.

Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Express, MongoDB, GitHub, VScode

    The best companies in the world

    My dedication to client satisfaction due to my years in customer service makes me uniquely qualified to produce user-centric code

   I solicit feedback from peers and mentors constantly for ways to improve applications as well as feedback from UX/UI coders for user friendly code


    Re-verifying wants and goals through check-ins with clients allows me to pivot and keep the programs tailored to each client as their needs change and more information is available
